## Notes

I really enjoyed this project because it felt like a very simple introduction to APIs, how to access, and parse the information they provide. Prior to this project, and this week's lab, I never had the opportunity to get hands on experience with APIs. They always seemed a bit daunting to tackle on my own, but this project showed me they can be pretty easy to work with. Unfortunately I had limited time to work on this app this week, however I do intend on going back and fiddling around a bit more with what can be done with this API.
